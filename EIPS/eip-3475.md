## Abstract

This API standard allows for the creation of any number of bonds type in a single contract. Existing LP token standards like [ERC-20](./eip-20.md) require deployment of separate factory and token contracts per token type. The need of issuing bonds with multiple redemption data can’t be achieved with existing token standards. ERC-3475 Multiple Callable Bonds Standard allows for each bond class ID to represent a new configurable token type, and for each bond nonce to represent an issuing date or any other forms of data in uint256. Every single nonce of a bond class may have its own metadata, supply and other redemption conditions.

## Motivation

Current LP token is a simple ERC-20 token, which has not much complicity in data structure. To allow more complex reward and redemption logic to be built, we need a new LP token standard that can manage multiple bonds, stores much more data and gas efficient. ERC-3475 standard interface allows any tokens on solidity compatible block chains to create its own bond. These bonds with the same interface standard can be exchanged in secondary market. And it allows any 3rd party wallet applications or exchanges to read the balance and the redemption conditions of these tokens. ERC-3475 bonds can also be packed into separate packages. Those packages can in their turn be divided and exchanged in a secondary market.

New functions built in ERC-3475 Multiple Callable Bonds Standard, will allow the users to economize their gas fee spend. Trading and burning of ERC-3475 Bonds will also multiply tokens market cap, helping it to recover from recession period. Existing structures, such as AMM exchanges or lending platform can be updated to recognize ERC-3475 Bonds.



## Specification

**definitions**
- Bank : is the enitity that issues , redeems or burns the bonds  after getting the necessary amount of liquidity. generally its an single entity having access to the pool.



**TransferFrom**

`transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 classId, uint256 nonceId, uint256 _amount)` allows the transfer of any number of bond types from an address to another.

The`"_from"` argument is the address of the holder whose balance about to decrees.

The `"_to"` argument is the address of the recipient whose balance is about to increased.

The `"classId"` is the bond class id.

The `"nonceId"` is a nonce id of the given bond class. This param is for distinctions of the issuing conditions of the bond.

The `"_amount"` is the amount of the bond, that will be transferred from `"_from"`address to `"_to"` address.

@dev transferFrom MUST have the approvalFrom check  to transfer _from address to _to address.


e.g.

```
transferFrom(0x2d03B6C79B75eE7aB35298878D05fe36DC1fE8Ef,0x82a55a613429Aeb3D01fbE6841bE1AcA4fFD5b2B, 1, 42, 500000000);
```

This example shows the transfer from `_from` address, to `_to` address , with `500000000` bonds  of  type class`1` and  nonce `42`


**Issue**

`issue(address _to, uint256 classId, uint256 nonceId, uint256 _amount)` allows issuing any number of bond types to an address.

The calling of this function needs to be restricted to bond issuer contract.

The `"_to"` argument is the address to which the bond will be issued.

The `"classId"` is the class id of the bond.

The `"nonceId"` is the nonce id of the given bond class. This param is for distinctions of the issuing conditions of the bond.

The `"_amount"` is the amount of the bond, that "_to" address will receive.

@dev It MUST be issued by single entity  (for instance role based ownable contract that has integration with the liquidity pool of the deposited collateral by _to address).

e.g.

```
issueBond(0x2d03B6C79B75eE7aB35298878D05fe36DC1fE8Ef, 0, 5, 1000);
```

This example shows the issuing to wallet address 0x2d03B6C79B75eE7aB35298878D05fe36DC1fE8Ef,quantity of 1000 bonds of type classId 0 and nonceId 5.



**Redeem**


`redeem(address _from, uint256 classId, uint256 nonceId, uint256 _amount)` redemption of bond from an address.

The `"_amount"` is the amount of the bond, that `"_from"` address will redeem.


@dev redeem function for given class and nonce category MUST BE  done only after certain conditions for maturity (can be end time , total active liquidity , etc). and it also needs to be called by only the controller contract (called as bank).

e.g.

```
redeem(0x2d03B6C79B75eE7aB35298878D05fe36DC1fE8Ef, 1, 42, 500000000);
```
those input mean “redeem from wallet address(0x2d03B6C79B75eE7aB35298878D05fe36DC1fE8Ef), 500000000 of bond class1 and nonce 42

### Metadata: 
The Metadata of a bond class or nonce are stored as an array of JSON objects , consisting of following  example : 

Description:
```json 

[
    {
        "title": "defning the title information",
        "type": "explaining the type of the title information added",
        "description": "little description about the information stored in  the bond",
    }
]
```
Nonce Metadata：
```json
[	
	{	
	"title": "symbol",
	"type": "str",
	"description": "Lorem ipsum..."
	"value": ["Class symbol 1", "Class symbol 2", "Class symbol 3"],
	},

	{	
	"title": "issuer",
	"type": "str",
	"description": "Lorem ipsum..."
	"value": ["Issuer name 1", "Issuer name 2", "Issuer name 3"],
	},

	{	
	"title": "issuer_address",
	"type": "address",
	"description": "Lorem ipsum..."
	"value":["Address 1.", "Address 2", "Address 3"]
	},

	{	
	"title": "class_type",
	"type": "str",
	"description": "Lorem ipsum..."
	"value": ["Class Type 1", "Class Type 2", "Class Type 3"]
	},

	{	
	"title": "token_address",
	"type": "address",
	"description": "Lorem ipsum..."
	"value":["Address 1.", "Address 2", "Address 3"]
	},

	{	
	"title": "period",
	"type": "int",
	"description": "Lorem ipsum..."
	"value": ["", "", ""]
	}
]
```
Nonce Metadata：
```json
[
	{	
	"title": "maturity",
	"type": "int",
	"description": "Lorem ipsum..."
	"value": ["", "", ""]
	}
]
```

The Key value for indexing the information is class field . following  are the rules : 
- the title can be any alpha numeric different type (although can dependent in certain jurisdiction based reductions).
-  the title SHOULD not non EMPTY .

also for example  there can be possibility to have localisation of the issuance / redemption of the bond , by describing the jurisdiction code (fr, de , cn rtc). by defining the "localisation" attribute as follows  :

```json
{	
"title": "localisation",
"type": "string",
"description": "jurisdiction law codes  compatiblity "
"value": ["fr ", "de", "ch"] // can also be ISO codes 
}
```

The integer in the values array can be regarded as the keys of the values stored in JSON metadata.

e.g. `classValues(uint256 classId)[0]` returns `2`. To get the `“symbol"` of the given class id, we can use the value returned as key to get the`“symbol"` value in the JSON metadata `"symbol 3"`
```json
	{	
"title": "symbol",
"type": "str",
"description": "Lorem ipsum..."
"value": ["Class Name 1", "Class Name 2", "DBIT Fix 6M"],
}
```
### EVENT

`"Issue"` MUST trigger when Bonds are issued. This SHOULD not include zero value Issuing.


e.g. 

`"issue by address(operator) 500 DEBIT-USD Bond(Nonce14) to 0x2d03B6C79B75eE7aB35298878D05fe36DC1fE8Ef"`

```
event Issue(address indexed _operator, address indexed _to, uint256 classId, uint256 nonceId, uint256 _amount); 
```

`"Redeem"` MUST trigger when Bonds are redeemed. This SHOULD not include zero value redemption.

e.g. 

`"redeem by address(_operator) 500 DEBIT-USD Bond(Nonce14) to 0x2d03B6C79B75eE7aB35298878D05fe36DC1fE8Ef"`

```
event Redeem(address indexed _operator, address indexed _from, uint256 classId, uint256 nonceId, uint256 _amount);
```

`"Burn"` MUST trigger when Bonds are burned. This SHOULD not include zero value burning.

e.g. 

`"burn by address(_operator) 500 DEBIT-USD Bond (Nonce14) from 0x2d03B6C79B75eE7aB35298878D05fe36DC1fE8Ef"`

```
event Burn(address indexed _operator, address indexed _from, uint256 classId, uint256 nonceId, uint256 amount);
```

`"Transfer"` MUST trigger when Bonds are transferred. This SHOULD not include zero value transfers. Transfer event with the `_from` `0x0` MUST not create this event(Use`"event Issued" `instead ). Transfer event with the `_to` `0x0` MUST not create this event(Use`"event Redeemed" `when redemption, and `"event Burned" `when burning).

e.g.

`"transfer by address(_operator) 500 DBIT-USD Bond(Nonce14) from 0x2d03B6C79B75eE7aB35298878D05fe36DC1fE8Ef, to address(_to)"`

```
event Transfer(address indexed _operator, address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256 classId, uint256 nonceId, uint256 _amount);
```

## Rationale

**Metadata structure**: Instead of utilizing a mapping from address, the bond's metadata like the time of redemption, redemption conditions, and interest rate can be stored in the bond class and nonce structures. Classes represent the different bond types, and nonces represent the various period of issuances. Nonces under the same class share the same metadata. Meanwhile, nonces are non-fungible. Each nonce can store a different set of metadata. Thus, upon transfer of a bond, all the metadata will be transferred to the new owner of the bond.

**Batch function**: ERC 3475 supports batch operations such as batch transactions. It allows the user to transfer different bonds along with their  metadata to a new address instantaneously in single txn . This mechanism helps in the "packaging" of bonds which is useful in usecases  like  package of bonds trades on a secondary market, the new owner holds the right to reclaim the face value of each of the bonds.

**AMM optimization**: One of the most obvious use cases of ERC 3475 is the multilayered pool. The early version of AMM uses a separate smart contract and an ERC 20 LP token to manage a pair. By doing so, the overall liquidity inside of one pool is significantly reduced and thus generates unnecessary gas spent and slippage. Using ERC 3475, one can build a big liquidity pool with all the pairs inside (thanks to the presence of the data structures consisting of the liquidity corresponding to the givenclass and nonde of bonds). Thus by knowing  class and nonce of the bonds , the liquidity can be  represented as the  percentage of a given token pair for the owner of the bond in the given pool. Effectively, the ERC20 LP token (represented by unique smart contract in the pool factory contract ) is converted, in this case, to ERC 3475 (Multiple Callable Bonds) token which is consolidated into single pool.


## Backwards Compatibility

ERC-3475 contract is not compatible with contracts that don't have an ERC-3475 interface built in. This requires the existing contract to upgrade with ERC-3475 interface. The receiving of ERC-3475 Bond need the implementation of ERC-3475 interface in the receiver contract.

However any existing ERC-20 token contract can issue their ERC-3475 bond, by giving the minting role to a bank contract with ERC-3475 interface built in. The implementation of This can be found in our Use Cases.

To ensure the reading of transactions, `"Issued"` ,`"Redeemed"` ,`"Burned"` ,`"Transfer"`, Events cited above MUST be emitted when such transaction is passed. 

***Note that the ERC 3475 interface is also compatible with ERC-20 and [ERC-721](./eip-721.md) interface .*** But the creation of a separated controller  contract is recommended for the operations and defining the logic .

The issuing of ERC-3475 bonds is not limited to ERC-20 token. Standard like ERC-721 nonfungible token can also issue their bond with the help of ERC-3475 interface. 

Any ERC3475 bond or any hybrid of ERC-20 and ERC-721 contract can be used as the collateral for further issuing  ERC-3475 bond on top of it. This allows the market to create bond represent no longer a single type of ERC-20 token. Bond can now represent a collection of collaterals in ERC-20 token, ERC-721 nonfungible token and ERC-3475 Multiple callable bonds...
