## Abstract

This API standard allows for the creation of any number of bonds type in a single contract. Existing LP token standards like ERC-20 require deployment of separate factory and token contracts per token type. The need of issuing bonds with multiple redemption data can’t be achieved with existing token standards. ERC-3475 Multiple Callable Bonds Standard allows for each bond class ID to represent a new configurable token type, and for each bond nonce to represent an issuing date or any other forms of data in uint256. Every single nonce of a bond class may have its own metadata, supply and other redemption conditions.

## Motivation

Current LP token is a simple ERC-20 token, which has not much complicity in data structure. To allow more complex reward and redemption logic to be built, we need a new LP token standard that can manage multiple bonds, stores much more data and gas efficient. ERC-3475 standard interface allows any tokens on solidity compatible block chains to create its own bond. These bonds with the same interface standard can be exchanged in secondary market. And it allows any 3rd party wallet applications or exchanges to read the balance and the redemption conditions of these tokens. ERC-3475 bonds can also be packed into separate packages. Those packages can in their turn be divided and exchanged in a secondary market.

New functions built in ERC-3475 Multiple Callable Bonds Standard, will allow the users to economize their gas fee spend. Trading and burning of ERC-3475 Bonds will also multiply tokens market cap, helping it to recover from recession period[(1)](https://medium.com/coinmonks/the-future-of-algorithmic-stable-coin-13ddbc27485). Existing structures, such as AMM exchanges or lending platform can be updated to recognize ERC-3475 Bonds.

### EVENT

`"Issued"` MUST trigger when Bonds are issued. This SHOULD not include zero value Issuing.


e.g. 

`"issue by address(operator) 500 DEBIT-USD Bond(Nonce14) to 0x2d03B6C79B75eE7aB35298878D05fe36DC1fE8Ef"`

```
event Issued(address _operator, address _to, uint256 class, uint256 nonce, uint256 _amount); 
```

`"Redeemed"` MUST trigger when Bonds are redeemed. This SHOULD not include zero value redemption.

e.g. 

`"redeem by address(_operator) 500 DEBIT-USD Bond(Nonce14) to 0x2d03B6C79B75eE7aB35298878D05fe36DC1fE8Ef"`

```
event Redeemed(address _operator, address _from, uint256 class, uint256 nonce, uint256 _amount);
```

`"Burned"` MUST trigger when Bonds are burned. This SHOULD not include zero value burning.

e.g. 

`"burn by address(_operator) 500 DEBIT-USD Bond(Nonce14) from 0x2d03B6C79B75eE7aB35298878D05fe36DC1fE8Ef"`

```
event eventBurnBond(address _operator, address _from, uint256 class, uint256 nonce, uint256 _amount);
```

`"Transferred"` MUST trigger when Bonds are transferred. This SHOULD not include zero value transfers. Transfer event with the `_from` `0x0` MUST not create this event(Use`"event Issued" `instead ). Transfer event with the `_to` `0x0` MUST not create this event(Use`"event Redeemed" `when redemption, and `"event Burned" `when burning).

e.g.

`"transfer by address(_operator) 500 DEBIT-USD Bond(Nonce14) from 0x2d03B6C79B75eE7aB35298878D05fe36DC1fE8Ef, to address(_to)"`

```
event eventTransferBond(address _operator, address _from, address _to, uint256 class, uint256 nonce, uint256 _amount);
```

## Backwards Compatibility

ERC-3475 contract is not Compatible with contracts that don't have an ERC-3475 interface built in. This requires the existing contract to upgrade with ERC-3475 interface. The receiving of ERC-3475 Bond need the implementation of ERC3475 interface in the receiver contract.

However any existing ERC-20 token contract can issue their ERC-3475 bond, by giving the minting role to a bonk contract with ERC-3475 interface built in. The implementation of This can be found in our Use Cases.

To ensure the reading of transactions, `"Issued"` ,`"Redeemed"` ,`"Burned"` ,`"Transferred"`, Events cited above MUST be emitted when such transaction is passed. 

***Note that the ERC 3475 interface is also compatible with ERC-20 and ERC-721 interface .*** But the creation of a separated bank contract is recommended for reading and future upgrade needs and .

The issuing of ERC-3475 bonds is not limited to ERC-20 token. Standard like ERC-721 nonfungible token can also issue their bond with the help of ERC-3475 interface. 

Any ERC3475 bond or any hybrid of ERC-20 and ERC-721 contract can be used as the collateral for another ERC-3475 bond. This allows the market to create bond represent no longer a single type of ERC-20 token. Bond can now represent a collection of collaterals in ERC-20 token, ERC-721 nonfungible token and ERC-3475 Multiple callable bonds...
