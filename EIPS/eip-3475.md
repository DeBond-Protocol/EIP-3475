## Abstract

This API standard allows for the creation of any number of bond types in a single contract. Existing LP token standards like [EIP-20](./eip-20.md) require the deployment of separate factories and token contracts per token type. Issuing bonds with multiple redemption data cannot be achieved with existing token standards. This proposal allows for each bond class ID to represent a new configurable token type, and for each bond nonce to represent an issuing date or any other form of data in uint256. Every single nonce of a bond class may have its own metadata, supply, and other redemption conditions.

## Motivation

Current LP tokens are simple ERC-20 tokens, which do not have a complex data structure. To allow more complex reward and redemption logic to be built, we need a new LP token standard that can manage multiple bonds, store more metadata for individual evaluation of bond operations, and be gas efficient. This proposal allows any token on a solidity-compatible EVM blockchain to create its own bond. These bonds with the same interface standard can be exchanged on secondary markets. It allows any 3rd party wallet applications or exchanges to read the balance and the redemption conditions of these tokens irrespective of the geographical/financial markets where they are traded throughout the world. ERC-3475 bonds can also be batched as tradeable instruments. Those instruments can then be divided and exchanged in secondary markets.

The functions defined in this EIP provide a gas-efficient solution for creating, trading, and burning bonds. The trading and burning of ERC-3475 Bonds will also increase the token market cap, helping it recover from the recession period. Existing structures, such as AMM exchanges or lending platforms, can be updated to recognize bonds created by this standard.

These bonds can also be batch called for issuance and, in turn, be divided and exchanged in a secondary market. The defined functions in this standard do operations on the serialized array, rather than storing them in struct mappings, giving significant benefits in storage and query gas costs. Trading and burning of these bonds will maintain market stability and adoption by:

-Providing more composability for building on other DeFi derivative products. 
-Maintaining the token market cap based on the variation in the market forces, helping it to recover from the recession period. Existing structures, such as AMM exchanges or lending platforms, can be updated to recognize ERC-3475 Bonds.


## Specification

**definitions**

- Bank: an entity that issues, redeems, or burns bonds after getting the necessary amount of liquidity. Generally, a single entity with access to the pool.

**TransferFrom**

`transferFrom(address _from, address _to, TRANSACTION[] calldata  _transaction)` allows the transfer of any number of bond types from an address to another.

The`_from` argument is the address of the holder whose balance about to decrease.

The `_to` argument is the address of the recipient whose balance is about to increased.

The `_transaction` is the `TRANSACTION[] calldata`  structure defined in the `rationale`.

@dev transferFrom MUST have the approvalFrom check to transfer "_from" address to "_to" address.

e.g.

``` solidity
function transferFrom(0x2d03B6C79B75eE7aB35298878D05fe36DC1fE8Ef, 0x82a55a613429Aeb3D01fbE6841bE1AcA4fFD5b2B, [{ 1, 42, 500000000}]);
```

transfer from `_from` address, to `_to` address,  `500000000` bonds  of  type class`1` and  nonce `42`.

**Issue**

`issue(address _to, TRANSACTION[] calldata _transaction)` allows issuing any number of bond types to an address.

The calling of this function needs to be restricted to bond issuer contracts.


The `_to` argument is the address to which the bond will be issued.


The `_transaction` is the `TRANSACTION[] calldata` structure defined in the  upcoming section rationale.

@dev It MUST be issued by a single entity (for instance, a role-based ownable contract that has integration with the liquidity pool of the deposited collateral by _to address).

e.g.

``` solidity
function issueBond(0x2d03B6C79B75eE7aB35298878D05fe36DC1fE8Ef, [{ 0, 5, 1000}]);
```

issues `1000` bonds with a class of `0` to address `0x2d03B6C79B75eE7aB35298878D05fe36DC1fE8Ef` with a nonce of `5`.

**Redeem**

`redeem(address _from, TRANSACTION[] calldata _transaction)` redemption of bond from an address.

The calling of this function needs to be restricted to bond issuer contract.

The `_from` is the address from which the bond will be redeemed.

The `_transaction` is the `TRANSACTION[] calldata`  structure defined in the rationale.

@dev redeem function for a given class and nonce category MUST BE done only after certain conditions for maturity (can be end time, total active liquidity, etc) are met. Furthermore, it SHOULD ONLY be called by the bank or secondary market maker contract.
e.g.

```
redeem(0x2d03B6C79B75eE7aB35298878D05fe36DC1fE8Ef, [{ 1, 42, 500000000}]);
```
those input mean “redeem from wallet address(0x2d03B6C79B75eE7aB35298878D05fe36DC1fE8Ef), 500000000 of bond class1 and nonce 42


**Burn**

`burn(address _from, TRANSACTION[] calldata _transaction)` allows the transfer of any number of bond types from an address to another.

The`"_from"` argument is the address of the holder whose balance is about to be decreased.


The `"_transaction` is the `TRANSACTION[] calldata` structure defined in the rationales.


@dev burn function for given class and nonce MUST BE called by only the controller contract .

e.g.

```
burnBond(0x82a55a613429Aeb3D01fbE6841bE1AcA4fFD5b2B,[{ 1, 42, 500000000}]);
```


**Approve**
`approve(address _spender, TRANSACTION[] calldata _transaction)` Allows `_spender` the rights to withdraw from the msg.sender the bonds of `_amount` and type (classId and nonceId).


If this function is called again, it overwrites the current allowance with the amount.


The "_spender"`  is the address the caller approves for his bonds defined by classId and nonceId.


The `"_transaction` is the `TRANSACTION[] calldata` structure defined in the rational section.
e.g.

``` Solidity 
approve(0x82a55a613429Aeb3D01fbE6841bE1AcA4fFD5b2B, [{ 0, 1, 30000}]);
```
means that address  0x82a55a613429Aeb3D01fbE6841bE1AcA4fFD5b2B is approved to manage 30000 bonds from class 0 and nonce 1

**SetApprovalFor**

### Metadata: 
The Metadata of a bond class or nonce are stored as an array of JSON objects, taking an example : 

Description:
```json 

[
    {
        "title": "defining the title information",
        "type": "explaining the type of the title information added",
        "description": "little description about the information stored in  the bond",
    }
]
```
Nonce Metadata：
```json
[	
	{	
	"title": "symbol",
	"type": "str",
	"description": "Lorem ipsum..."
	"value": ["Class symbol 1", "Class symbol 2", "Class symbol 3"],
	},

	{	
	"title": "issuer",
	"type": "str",
	"description": "Lorem ipsum..."
	"value": ["Issuer name 1", "Issuer name 2", "Issuer name 3"],
	},

	{	
	"title": "issuer_address",
	"type": "address",
	"description": "Lorem ipsum..."
	"value":["Address 1.", "Address 2", "Address 3"]
	},

	{	
	"title": "class_type",
	"type": "str",
	"description": "Lorem ipsum..."
	"value": ["Class Type 1", "Class Type 2", "Class Type 3"]
	},

	{	
	"title": "token_address",
	"type": "address",
	"description": "Lorem ipsum..."
	"value":["Address 1.", "Address 2", "Address 3"]
	},

	{	
	"title": "period",
	"type": "int",
	"description": "Lorem ipsum..."
	"value": ["", "", ""]
	}
]
```
Nonce Metadata：
```json
[
	{	
	"title": "maturity",
	"type": "int",
	"description": "Lorem ipsum..."
	"value": ["", "", ""]
	}
]
```

The key value for indexing the information is class field . following  are the rules : 

- The title can be any alpha numeric type that is differentiated by the description of metadata (although can dependent in certain jurisdiction based reductions).
- The title SHOULD not non EMPTY .

also for example  there can be possibility to have localisation of the issuance / redemption of the bond, by describing the jurisdiction code (fr, de, cn rtc) as follows:
```json
{
"title": "localisation",
"type": "string",
"description": "jurisdiction law codes  compatiblity "
"value": ["fr ", "de", "ch"] // can also be ISO codes 
}
```

The integer in the values array can be regarded as the keys to the values stored as JSON object.

e.g. `classValues(uint256 classId)[0]` returns `2`. To get the `“symbol"` of the given class id, we can use the value returned as key to get the`“symbol"` value in the JSON metadata `"symbol 3"`
```json
    {
"title": "symbol",
"type": "str",
"description": "Lorem ipsum..."
"value": ["Class Name 1", "Class Name 2", "DBIT Fix 6M"],
}
```

### EVENT

`"Issue"` MUST trigger when Bonds are issued. This SHOULD not include zero value Issuing.


e.g. 

`"issue by address(operator) 500 DEBIT-USD Bond(Nonce14) to 0x2d03B6C79B75eE7aB35298878D05fe36DC1fE8Ef"`

```
event Issue(address indexed _operator, address indexed _to, TRANSACTION[] _transaction); 
```

`"Issue"` MUST be triggered when operator (Bank) contract issues bonds to the given entity.
 

```Solidity
event Redeem(address indexed _operator, address indexed _from, uint256 classId, uint256 nonceId, uint256 _amount);
```

`"Redeem"` MUST trigger when Bonds are redeemed. This SHOULD not include zero value redemption.


Redeem(0x2d03B6C79B75eE7aB35298878D05fe36DC1fE8Ef,0x492Af743654549b12b1B807a9E0e8F397E44236E,{1,14,500});


means that the 5000 bonds of class 1, nonce 14  owned by address  0x492Af743654549b12b1B807a9E0e8F397E44236E are being redeemed by  0x2d03B6C79B75eE7aB35298878D05fe36DC1fE8Ef.


```solidity
Burn(address indexed _operator, address indexed _from, TRANSACTION[] _transaction)
```

Burn(0x2d03B6C79B75eE7aB35298878D05fe36DC1fE8Ef,0x492Af743654549b12b1B807a9E0e8F397E44236E,{1,14,500});

meaning that 5000 bonds of  owner 0x492Af743654549b12b1B807a9E0e8F397E44236E of type (class 1, nonce 4 )  are burned by operator 0x2d03B6C79B75eE7aB35298878D05fe36DC1fE8Ef.

`"Burn"`MUST trigger when the bonds are being redeemed via staking (or being invalidated ) by the bank contract.
`"Burn"` MUST trigger when Bonds are burned. This SHOULD not include zero value burning.



```Solidity
event Transfer(address indexed _operator, address indexed _from, address indexed _to, TRANSACTION[] _transaction);
```

`"Transfer"` MUST trigger when Bonds are transferred. This SHOULD not include zero value transfers. Transfer event with the `_from` `0x0` MUST not create this event(Use`"event Issued" `instead ). Transfer event with the `_to` `0x0` MUST not create this event(Use`"event Redeemed" `when redemption, and `"event Burned" `when burning).


ex: Transfer( 0x2d03B6C79B75eE7aB35298878D05fe36DC1fE8Ef, 0x492Af743654549b12b1B807a9E0e8F397E44236E, address  _to, {1,4,500});


"transfer by address(_operator) amount  500 DBIT-USD Bonds with (Class 1 and Nonce 14) from 0x2d03B6C79B75eE7aB35298878D05fe36DC1fE8Ef, to address(_to)"   .



## Rationale

**Metadata structure**: Instead of utilizing a mapping from address, the bond's metadata like the time of redemption, redemption conditions, and interest rate can be stored in the bond class and nonce structures. Classes represent the different bond types, and nonces represent the various period of issuances. Nonces under the same class share the same metadata. Meanwhile, nonces are non-fungible. Each nonce can store a different set of metadata. Thus, upon transfer of a bond, all the metadata will be transferred to the new owner of the bond.

```solidity
    struct METADATA {
        string title;
        string types;
        string description;
        string[] values;
    }
```
**Batch function:** ERC 3475 supports batch operations such as batch transaction. It allows the user to transfer different bonds along with their metadata to a new address instantaneously in single txn . This mechanism helps in the "packaging" of bonds which is useful in usecases like  trades on a secondary market. and after execution,  new owner holds the right to reclaim the face value of each of the bonds.


```solidity
    struct TRANSACTION {
        uint256 classId;
        uint256 nonceId;
        uint256 _amount;
    }
```
Where

The "classId" is the class id of the bond.

The "nonceId" is the nonce id of the given bond class. This param is for distinctions of the issuing conditions of the bond.

The "_amounts" is the list of amounts of the bond that the spender is approved for.


**AMM optimization**: One of the most obvious use cases of ERC 3475 is the multilayered pool. The early version of AMM uses a separate smart contract and an ERC 20 LP token to manage a pair. By doing so, the overall liquidity inside of one pool is significantly reduced and thus generates unnecessary gas spent and slippage. Using ERC 3475, one can build a big liquidity pool with all the pairs inside (thanks to the presence of the data structures consisting of the liquidity corresponding to the given class and nonce of bonds). Thus by knowing class and nonce of the bonds, the liquidity can be represented as the percentage of a given token pair for the owner of the bond in the given pool. Effectively, the ERC20 LP token (represented by unique smart contract in the pool factory contract ) is converted, in this case, to ERC 3475 (Multiple Callable Bonds) token which is consolidated into single pool.




## Backwards Compatibility

ERC-3475 contract is  compatible with contracts that  inherit  ERC-3475 interface .Its valid for both the issuer and receiver of the bonds, the client EOA needs the IERC3475 interface.

However any existing ERC-20 token contract can issue their ERC-3475 bond, by delegating the  the minting role to a bank  contract with ERC-3475 interface built in. The implementation of This can be found in our reference implementation.

To ensure the reading of transactions, `"Issued"`,`"Redeemed"`,`"Burned"`,`"Transfer"`, Events cited above MUST be emitted when such transaction is passed. 

***Note that the ERC 3475 interface is also compatible with ERC-20 and [ERC-721](./eip-721.md) interface .*** 
But the creation of a separated bank contract is recommended for reading and future upgrade needs.


Acceptable collateral can be in the form of [EIP-20](./eip-20.md) tokens, [EIP-721](./eip-721.md) tokens, or other bonds.
.Bond can now represent a collection of collaterals in ERC-20 token, ERC-721 nonfungible token and ERC-3475 Multiple callable bonds...
